# React-Redux-Saga project

A basic React component, it uses redux-saga library to drive data from an async API call. 
This basic component tries to be something like an app, which allows to view users (one per call), create and/or delete users (__Note:__ _for the moment this last two tasks are dynamic and not persistent_).

Because is a challenge project and not much time has given; the component is in a initial state of development and yet, 
it contains errors or some unexpected behaviors, but the idea and the basic functionality I think exists. 

I will try to work in this component a little more in a future...
